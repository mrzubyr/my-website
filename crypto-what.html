        Cryptocurrency is digital or virtual money that uses cryptography for security, making it almost impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (like Naira or USD), cryptocurrencies are decentralized and usually operate on a blockchain, which is a public ledger of all transactions. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Popular cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and USDT. People use crypto for investment, trading, remittances, and sometimes for buying goods and services online.

    <p>
        Key features of cryptocurrency:
        <ul>
            <li>Decentralized – no central authority controls it</li>
            <li>Secure – uses cryptography for transactions</li>
            <li>Transparent – transactions are recorded on a blockchain</li>
            <li>Pseudonymous – you can transact without revealing personal info</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
